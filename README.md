our skin cancer detection project demonstrates the efficacy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in conjunction with a meticulously processed dataset derived from HAM10000. Leveraging transfer learning with DenseNet169 and ResNet50, our models showcase robust performance in object detection and classification. The comparative analysis of undersampling and oversampling techniques reveals nuanced insights into model behavior, providing a basis for strategic selection in skin cancer diagnostic applications. 
Furthermore, our extension explores novel models such as Xception, DenseNet201, and InceptionV3, aiming for an improved accuracy of 95%. The incorporation of advanced image processing techniques, including shear transformations, zooming, and morphological transformations, enhances the dataset's diversity and model generalization capabilities. The inpainting algorithm contributes to dataset completeness, addressing potential imperfections. 
Our project not only contributes to the evolving landscape of dermatological diagnostics but also emphasizes the importance of continuous exploration and refinement. By embracing cutting-edge models and diverse image processing strategies, we anticipate a significant advancement in skin cancer detection accuracy, paving the way for more effective preventive and diagnostic measures in the realm of dermatology.
