1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
	-  Skin Cancer Data
	- Detection
3. Image processing
	- using ImageDataGenerator 
		- Re-scaling the Image
		- Shear Transformation
		- Zooming the Image
		- Horizontal Flip 
		- Reshaping the Image 
		- Segmentation
			- Applying Morphological Black-Hat transformation
			- Creating the mask for InPainting task
			- Applying inpainting algorithm on the image
4. Building the model 
	- Classification
	    - ResNet50
	    - DenseNet169
	    - VGG16
	    - Xception
	    - DenseNet201
	- Detection
		- YoloV5
		- YoloV6
		- YoloV7
		- YoloV8
   
5. Training the model
6. Building the model 


Flask Framework
----------------
 
7. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
8. Importing the packages
9. User Upload an image for analysis
10. The given input is preprocessed and segmented 
11. The trained model is used for predicting the result
12. Final Outcome is display 


Extension
------------
In the base paper, the author mentioned to use different models for analysis the Skin cancer dataset using ResNet50, DenseNet161 and VGG16 
from which ResNet50 model got 90% of train accuracy,
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other techniques such Xception, DenseNet201 model for classification
from which Xception got 96% of accuracy, 
ALong with that we applied Yolo Models(Version of V5,V6,V7,V8) for detection skin disease region,
With the above As an extension we can build the front end using flask framework for user testing with authentication.
